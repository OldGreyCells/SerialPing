 * DISCLAIMER:
 * This software is furnished "as is", without technical support, and with no 
 * warranty, express or implied, as to its usefulness for any purpose.
 *
 * BACKGROUND:
 * This library was first written for the nearmiss-o-meter (https://github.com/OldGreyCells/nearmiss-o-meter)
 * so serial sonars could be 'dropped' into the main Arduino code.
 *
 * FEATURES:
 * - Partially API compatible with the NewPing library.
 * - Currently supports two serial ultrasonic sonars:
 *   - http://en.dypsensor.com/products/&pmcId=42.html
 *   - https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=US-100+Ultrasonic+Distance+Sensor+Module
 * - Does not support the Maxbotix sonars as they use a peculiar 
 *   hybrid serial RX + pin HIGH trigger.
 * - Works with hardware Serial and SoftwareSerial.
 * - Returns distances in whole cm by default, not uS.
 * - Can set a maximum distance where pings beyond that distance return 0cm.
 *
 * CONSTRUCTOR:
 *   SerialPing sonar(Stream, [, max_cm_distance [, sensor_id]])
 *     Stream - Either HardwareSerial or SoftwareSerial.
 *     max_cm_distance - [Optional] Maximum distance you wish to sense. Default=500cm.
 *     sensor_id - [Optional] Either SONAR_US_100 (default) or SONAR_ME007_ULS
 *
 * METHODS:
 *   sonar.ping() - Send a ping and get the echo time (in cm) as a result. 
 *   sonar.ping_in() - Send a ping and get the distance in whole inches.
 *   sonar.ping_cm() - Send a ping and get the distance in whole centimeters.
 *   sonar.ping_median(iterations) - Do multiple pings (default=5), discard out of range pings and return median in cm. 
 *   sonar.convert_in(cm) - Convert from cm to inches (rounds to nearest inch).
 *   sonar.convert_cm(cm) - convert cm to cm(!). For NewPing API compatability only.
